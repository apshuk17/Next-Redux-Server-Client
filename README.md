This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is created to understand the Redux state management in the Next.js.

Packages used:
1. Reduxjs Toolkit
2. React Redux
3. Next Redux Wrapper

In this project there are 2 pages, one is using getStaticProps while the other is using getServerSideProps.

Here, we understood how to sync the data or state between the server side store and the client side store.
